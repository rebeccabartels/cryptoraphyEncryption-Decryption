# Symmetric vs Asymmetric

## Instructions

### Categorization

For each of the following scenarios, determine whether Symmetric or Asymmetric cryptography is more appropriate, and which of the four goals of cryptography is most relevant to the scenario

- You're sending the final version of a treaty to Parliament, and want everyone to know that _you_ are the one who sent it.
  - **Solution**: Asymmetric cryptography is better, as it can be used with digital signatures to ensure **non-repudiation** and **authenticity**.

- You're sending a letter to your spouse, and don't want anyone else to be able to read it. Assume you've already shared whichever keys you'll need.
  - **Solution**: Either form of cryptography works for this, but symmetric is the simpler solution for ensuring **privacy**.

- You need to send a message and ensure that no one tampers with it while its in transit.
  - **Solution**: Asymmetric cryptography allows for easy verification of **integrity**.

- You need to encrypt data before storing it in a database, but only have limited computational power, since you're building code for a mobile phone.
  - **Solution**: Symmetric encryption is faster.

### Hybrid Cryptosystems

In order for a recipient to decode a message encrypted with a symmetric key, they must, of course, acquire the symmetric key. 

But, transmitting this key securely is a serious challenge.

Recall that, with asymmetric key algorithms, you use a public key to encrypt data, and a private key to decrypt it.

Consider the following:
- You have a public key, which you share with anyone who wants to send you encrypted messages.
- You have a private key, which you can use to decrypt messages encrypted with your public key.
- Your partner has a symmetric key, which they'll use to encrypt any messages they send you.

How can you use asymmetric cryptography to safely transmit the symmetric key?
- **Solution**: Follow the steps below.
  - First, your partner encrypts the symmetric key with your _public key_
  - Then, they send you the encrypted symmetric key, which you then decrypt with your _private key_.
  - Next, they send you the messages they've encrypted with their _symmetric_ key.
  - Finally, you decrypt their message with the symmetric key you decrypted.
